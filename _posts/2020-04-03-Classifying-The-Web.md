# Key Takeaways
  - **25.1%**  
    - The approximate percentage of websites that can be classified as businesses or e-commerce related on the open web.
  - **650 Million** 
    - The number of web pages that are potential businesses that B2B marketers could market to. This number is based on 2.6 Billion web pages collected in February of 2020 by a web archive called Common Crawl.
  - **11 to 1** 
    - Based on the above analysis, for every 11 people in the world there is one business.

# Background
In this excercise I will be examining the use of web archive data to produce valuable insights and data assets for B2B marketers. Specifically, knowing whether a website is a business or not is a very important first step. I will be walking through the steps required to produce a dataset that can put data scientists on a path to extracting this valuable information for their marketing teams. 

# Problem Statement
  - **Is it possible to use data from the web to identify businesses?**
  
    I wanted to develop a machine learning model that can look at the raw text of a web page and determine whether it is a business or not. 
   
# Goal
The ultimate goal here is to use a classifier to produce a curated list of business websites that can then be further categorized based on keywords. These further categorizations will, for instance, classify a business as being a pizza parlor, a flower shop or a bank. This sort of information is key in targeted B2B marketing. A final goal would be to pull all relevant contact information such as e-mail  phone and address.

# Approach
The approach I will be taking here is threefold:

1. **Dataset: ** <img src="../images/common-crawl.png" alt="Common Crawl" title="Common Crawl" width="200" height="75" />

[Common Crawl](http://www.commoncrawl.org) is an open dataset of archive data from the web. This data is refreshed monthly 

# Conclusion

**Final Thoughts**

**Code** - All python code for this project can be found in my GitHub respository: [GitHub](https://github.com/skhan-tech/BusinessClassifier)
